# Software-Inc-Trainer-V3
!Attention: this is fan-made version 3 trainer based on V3 source (see below), because there was NO official update V3 for alpha 10 by Trawis.

This Trainer is for Software Inc game. It's based on https://github.com/Trawis/SoftwareIncDLLModifications by Trawis and https://github.com/hrkrx/SoftwareIncDLLModifications by hrkrx

*NOTE: I can't guarantee that some features integrated in this trainer will work with old saves. If you want to test it out, please backup your data first.

Download Trainer_V3.dll and put in the DLLMods folder in your Software Inc directory. If the directory does not exist, create it.
